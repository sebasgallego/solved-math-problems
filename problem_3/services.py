# Sum square difference.

# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# the first 10 terms will be:
# 1 2 + 2 2 + . . . + 10 2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# ( 1 + 2 + . . . + 10 ) 2 = 55 2 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
# and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
